MAIN CONCEPT: SWITCH
In switch you are a pixel guy by the name of One (brilliant right?)
You're minding your own business when suddenly you're given powers that allow you to switch with your alternate: Zero
(Aren't I so good with names!?) You have to solve puzzles by switching between one another to get to the end goal.
It's a simple game but it would be good to start with!
Hope it isn't too much trouble!
