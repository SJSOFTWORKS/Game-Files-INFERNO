Hey Jonah!
You may be wondering why I moved everything into a different folder. 
This is because I think that Inferno might have been too much to handle at the moment.
I think we should start with something basic so that we won't be completely burnt out when we decide to make a new game.
The game I have in mind sparked from the latest prototype you put up.
I had an error in which the person you play as would switch with the other when they come in contact with each other. But those puzzles might be a bit complex so I thought both can be contoled by using I,J,K,L and the usual wsad.
This would be a great puzzle game and nobody has made one like this after I did some research.
We're not too far in with development of Inferno and plus this will give us good skills that we can apply later in inferno.
So wadya say ol' buddy o' mine? Sound good?
-Sam
I'll have the deet's on the website.
